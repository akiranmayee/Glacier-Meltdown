Steps after data collection -
Data Preprocessing:

Missing Data Handling:
If any entries are missing, you can fill them with the mean, median, or use interpolation techniques.

Feature Scaling:
Features like Temperature and Glacier Thickness may have different units, so you should normalize or standardize the data to make sure all features are on the same scale.

Feature Engineering:

Create a new feature, Glacier Mass Loss, by computing the difference in Glacier Mass Balance over time.

Convert the Date into Year, Month, and Day of Year to capture any seasonal effects.

Categorical Data Encoding:

For the Season feature, use One-Hot Encoding to convert it into multiple binary columns (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall).

Model Building (Machine Learning Model):

Now, we can build a machine learning model to predict Glacier Meltdown or the Glacier Mass Loss based on the input features.

Target Variable: Glacier Mass Loss (kg/mÂ² or in cm of ice equivalent per year)

Model Choice:

Linear Regression: For a simple baseline model to predict the mass loss.

Random Forest Regression: If there is non-linear behavior in the relationship between the features and target.

Gradient Boosting: For a more advanced approach that can help capture complex patterns in the data.

Model Steps:

Split the data into train and test sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

Evaluate using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared to see how well the model predicts glacier meltdown.

Training:

Train the chosen model using the training set.

Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters using grid search or random search.

Model Evaluation:
After training, you can evaluate the model's accuracy using the test set.

Key Metrics:

MSE (Mean Squared Error): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

R-squared: Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable that the model explains.
